# React Food Order App

## Introduction

This is my Food Order React App. It includes a list of Meals items, Add button, and a Your Cart button where you can see your order.

After runnig the app you will see a order food app. There is a Add button for every meals items with click on it you can add it to the Cart. On the header you see the Your Cart Button after clicking you will see your order and its price. Here there are four buttons + , - , Close, and Order.

+: add more items.

-: remove items.

Close: close the cart.

Order: order items.

For developing this app, I tried to use practically React Hook like useContext, useReducer, useState, useEffect.
